  infrastructure: # You can change this name to anything else you wish
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # This could also be a windows machine e.g windows-latest

          resourceGroupName: ${{ vars.NODEJS_RG }} # This doesn't have to be a variable, you could also hard code this, but ensure you create a variable if you use this approach
          template: ./devops/dev/main.environment.bicep # This is an assumed directory structure ensure you change to the correct directory as well as rename environment to uat or prod etc
